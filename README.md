## 🚀 Overview
The **AI-Powered Personalized Learning Platform** is a full-stack web application that delivers **personalized learning content** to users based on their progress, preferences, and performance. It leverages **machine learning models** for content recommendation, **adaptive learning algorithms** for difficulty adjustment, and **analytics dashboards** to track learning progress.

This project demonstrates **end-to-end system design**, combining **frontend, backend, database, ML models, and cloud deployment**, making it **Google/MAANG-interview ready**.

---

## 🌟 Features
- **User Authentication & Profiles:** Track progress, completed lessons, and performance.
- **AI-Powered Content Recommendation:** ML-driven personalized suggestions.
- **Analytics Dashboard:** Visualize learning trends and strengths/weaknesses.
- **Adaptive Learning:** Difficulty adjusts dynamically based on performance.
- **Cloud-Ready Deployment:** Dockerized, CI/CD-ready, deployable on GCP or AWS.
- **Optional AI Tutor:** Chatbot for real-time Q&A.

v
[Analytics & Dashboards]

- Users interact via frontend → backend handles API requests.
- ML engine provides recommendations and adaptive difficulty.
- Analytics dashboard visualizes learning patterns and progress.
- Optional: Dockerized containers deployed to cloud (GCP/AWS).
